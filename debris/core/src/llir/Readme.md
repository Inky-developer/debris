# The Low-Level Intermediate Representation For The Debris Language

The LLIR has a syntax similar to minecraft commands but tries to be as version agnostic as possible, while not being less powerful than minecraft commands.
The focus lies on mathematical operations, so a lot of computation is done one scoreboards
Nonetheless, the LLIR has extensive capabilities to work with nbt data in data storages or entities and to convert to and from nbt (todo).
I am not sure how to support every single minecraft command that is not strictly required for a turing complete language.
