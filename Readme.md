# Debris Language
Debris is a powerful language & compiler which aims to make the process of creating a datapack easier and quicker.
For a working prototype in python, take a look at [McScript](https://github.com/Inky-developer/mcscript).

## Status
This language is in a *very* early state. 

Goal for version 0.1: Feature parity with the mcscript prototype
