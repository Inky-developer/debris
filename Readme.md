# Debris Language
[![ci](https://github.com/Inky-developer/debris/workflows/ci/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Inky-developer/debris/actions)

Debris is a powerful language & compiler which aims to make the process of creating a datapack easier and quicker.
For a working prototype in python, take a look at [McScript](https://github.com/Inky-developer/mcscript).

## Status
This language is in a *very* early state. 

Documentation for the Project can be found [here](https://inky-developer.github.io/debris/debris_lang/)
